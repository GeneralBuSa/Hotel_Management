Hotel Management System
Welcome to the Hotel Management System! This program helps hotel administrators manage room statuses efficiently, allowing them to view, update, and save room information to files. The program supports different room types and provides functionality to track room availability, engagement status, and more.

Features
Display Rooms: View the current status of all rooms in the hotel.
Update Room Status: Update the status of rooms (Available, Engaged, Cleaning).
Save Hotel Status to File: Save the current room status to a text file.
Load Hotel Status from File: Load the previously saved room statuses from a text file.
Room Types
This system supports two types of rooms:

Suit Rooms (S): Premium rooms with luxurious amenities.
Standard Rooms (R): Regular rooms with essential amenities.
There are 50 rooms in total:

The first 25 rooms are Suit Rooms (S1, S2, ..., S25).
The next 25 rooms are Standard Rooms (R1, R2, ..., R25).

Code Structure
Classes
Room: A base class for representing rooms, containing details such as the room number and status.
SuitRoom: A derived class that represents suit rooms, inheriting from the Room class.
StandardRoom: A derived class that represents standard rooms, also inheriting from the Room class.
Hotel: A class responsible for managing the rooms. It provides functions to display room statuses, update them, and save/load to/from a file.
File Operations
The program saves the room statuses to a file named hotel_status.txt and retrieves them when needed. This allows the program to retain room status information even after it is closed.
